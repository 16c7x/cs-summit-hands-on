# Extra Credit

Here are a few things you might also like to do, if you have extra time.

## Manually trigger a pipeline

* Switch to a control repository or module,
* Click "manual actions" and select "trigger pipeline",
* Select "master",
* Select the most recent commit,
* Leave "pull request" unchecked,
* Click "done", and
* Watch it go.

## Manually trigger an impact analysis

* Click "manual actions" and select "impact analysis"m
* Choose a commit to compare nodes' current state with,
* Choose an environment to analyze,
* Click "done", and
* Watch it go.

## Manually deploy a particular commit to a given environment.  This can be useful if a customer wants to manage their code with CD4PE but can't let an automatic pipeline promote master all the way through a linear progression.

* Click "manual actions" and select "deployment",
* Choose a commit,
* Choose an environment,
* Click "done", and
* Watch it go.
